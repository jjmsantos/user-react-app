# user-react-app

---

- A simple react app that saves a user and age input.
- This basic react app will have error modals for missing inputs and/or negative numbers for age.
- This app is a project that I will be creating with the help of some udemy classes.

App is designed to help the dev learn and understand basic knowledge of React.

- This includes the use of components, managing user input states, and handling errors
